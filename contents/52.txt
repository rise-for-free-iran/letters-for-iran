As an Iranian-American, I'm writing about an unprecedented opportunity for U.S. foreign policy.

The Iranian people are overthrowing the Islamic Republic—the regime that has funded Hezbollah, pursued nuclear weapons, and destabilized the Middle East for nearly five decades. They're doing it themselves, at enormous cost: 12,000+ killed in just 48 hours.

The regime has shut down all internet to hide the massacres. We can't reach our families.

What they need from America: Starlink to restore communications, sanctions on regime leaders, and recognition of a transitional government.

What America gains: an ally of 90 million educated, pro-American people with vast resources in the world's most strategic region.

This is the moment. Please lead.
