I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a point where delay itself has consequences.

Across the country, millions of people are no longer demanding reforms. They are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright, even as the risks grow more severe by the day.

The regime’s response has been lethal: shootings in the streets, mass arrests, targeted violence against the wounded, and a deliberate shutdown of internet and communications to hide its actions.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. positioning now—on accountability for violence, challenging information blackouts, and readiness for a post-regime transition—can shorten the violence and shape a more stable outcome.

Sincerely,
