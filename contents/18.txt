I am _____, an Iranian in the United States, writing because what happens in Iran now will echo far beyond its borders.

Across the country, millions of people are no longer demanding reforms. They are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright, even as the risks grow more severe by the day.

Violence, arrests, and an engineered information blackout now define the state’s response—measures that signal fear, not strength.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. leadership now will help determine whether that change is shorter and less violent, or prolonged and chaotic.

Sincerely,
