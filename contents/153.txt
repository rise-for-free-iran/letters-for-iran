My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Only global attention can help protect lives now.

Sincerely,
_____
