I am _____, an Iranian-American living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a turning point with global implications.

Millions of Iranians are no longer calling for reform but for the end of the Islamic Republic itself.

The regime has responded with lethal force, mass arrests, and a communications blackout designed to hide violence and silence witnesses.

For decades, this government has fueled terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, and threatened U.S. interests through nuclear escalation and energy insecurity.

U.S. leadership now—public accountability, technological support to restore internet access, and readiness to recognize a transitional government—can shorten the crisis.

Iran is approaching change. Leadership now will shape its cost.

Sincerely,
