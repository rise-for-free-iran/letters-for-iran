My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a moment where outcomes are being decided in real time.

This is not a protest movement. It is the breakdown of a regime that has lost legitimacy and now survives through violence and isolation. Millions of Iranians across the country are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic despite severe risks.

The regime’s response has been lethal force against civilians, mass arrests, and a deliberate shutdown of internet and communications to hide repression. These actions reflect fear, not control.

For decades, this regime has been a central driver of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy security. Its survival has repeatedly harmed U.S. interests. A transition away from this regime would fundamentally change the strategic landscape of the Middle East.

Clear U.S. positioning now—on accountability for violence, challenging information blackouts, and readiness for a post-regime transition—can shorten the violence and shape a more stable outcome. Ambiguity will do the opposite.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. leadership now will influence how costly that change becomes.

Sincerely,
