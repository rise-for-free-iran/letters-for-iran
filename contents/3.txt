As an Iranian-American constituent, I, _____, am writing about the crisis in Iran where millions are fighting for the same freedoms we have in America.

Since late December, millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities have risen against 47 years of tyranny. The regime has massacred over 12,000 people in just 48 hours—one murder every 14 seconds. They're hunting wounded protesters in hospitals and burying victims in mass graves.
Iran is now under complete digital blackout. Internet connectivity is at 1%. We cannot reach our families or know what's happening.
The Iranian people need targeted U.S. action:

* Target IRGC leadership to stop the killing
* Block regime assets and oil smuggling operations
* Deploy Starlink to break the internet blackout
* Expel Iranian diplomats and pursue accountability for crimes against humanity
* Commit to recognizing a democratic transitional government

These people are fighting for separation of religion and state, individual liberty, and democracy.

America has everything to gain from a free Iran. This regime has exported terror, pursued nuclear weapons, and destabilized the region for 47 years. A democratic Iran will end this cycle and become a pillar of Middle East peace and prosperity. The Iranian people love America—after liberation, you'll see "Welcome America" replace "Death to America." Iran's highly educated population (70% women in engineering), vast natural resources, and strategic location will strengthen global supply chains and U.S. economic interests. A free Iran could join expanded Abraham Accords, transforming regional security. Supporting freedom fighters now prevents future conflicts and creates a natural U.S. ally.
Please act now—introduce legislation, press the Administration, and stand publicly with those fighting for freedom.

Every day of silence means more deaths.

Respectfully,
