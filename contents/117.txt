I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing to emphasize that what is happening in Iran is neither temporary nor negotiable.

Millions of Iranians are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright. This is not reform politics but a decisive break with a system that has lost legitimacy.

The regime has answered with mass killings, arrests, and a sweeping internet blackout to hide repression and isolate the population.

For decades, this government has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, endangered global energy routes, and pursued nuclear ambitions that threaten U.S. security.

Clear U.S. action—public accountability, technological support to break the blackout, and readiness to recognize a legitimate transitional authority—can shorten the crisis.

Iran is changing. The cost of that change is still being determined.

Sincerely,
