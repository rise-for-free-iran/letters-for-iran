Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
