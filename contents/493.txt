Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
