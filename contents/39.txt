I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because Iran has reached a point where outcomes are being decided in real time.

This is regime breakdown, not protest. Millions openly reject the Islamic Republic despite lethal force, mass arrests, and communications blackout designed to hide repression.

For the U.S., this regime has been the central driver of terrorism, instability, and nuclear threats. A transition away fundamentally changes Middle East strategy.

CLEAR U.S. POSITIONING NOW:
* Challenge information blackouts
* Accountability for violence
* Preparation for post-regime transition

U.S. clarity can shorten violence and shape stable outcomes. Ambiguity does the opposite.

Sincerely,
