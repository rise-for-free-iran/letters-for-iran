I am _____, an Iranian-American constituent, writing because Iran is witnessing atrocities on a scale that demands international response.

Millions of people across the country are demanding an end to clerical dictatorship. The regime has answered with mass killings, arrests, and the deployment of armed forces against civilians.

At the same time, Iran has been plunged into a digital blackout. Internet access has collapsed, erasing evidence and cutting families off from one another.

This regime has spent decades threatening U.S. interests through terrorism, nuclear escalation, and regional chaos.

Clear U.S. action—economic pressure, technological support to restore communications, and readiness to recognize a transitional government—can save lives and hasten an inevitable change.

Inaction empowers repression.

Respectfully,
