I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because events in Iran are accelerating faster than the world’s response.

What began as resistance has become a nationwide break with a regime sustained only by force, censorship, and fear.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

The Islamic Republic has long been a central driver of regional instability, proxy warfare, nuclear risk, and global energy insecurity.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. leadership now will help determine whether that change is shorter and less violent, or prolonged and chaotic.

Sincerely,
_____
