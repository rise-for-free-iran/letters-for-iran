My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I respectfully ask you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Only global attention can help protect lives now.

Sincerely,
_____
