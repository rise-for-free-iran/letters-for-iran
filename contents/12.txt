I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian who believes this moment in Iran will define the next generation.

This is not unrest or a policy dispute. It is the collapse of a governing system that has lost legitimacy and now relies almost entirely on violence and isolation.

Violence, arrests, and an engineered information blackout now define the state’s response—measures that signal fear, not strength.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. leadership now will help determine whether that change is shorter and less violent, or prolonged and chaotic.

Sincerely,
