Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

Iranians have been isolated through shutdowns of mobile and online networks.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
