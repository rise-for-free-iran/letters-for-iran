I am _____, an Iranian-American constituent, writing because what is happening in Iran now will define the region for decades.

Millions of people across Iran are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic despite lethal consequences. This is not a protest movement—it is a population attempting to free itself from a system sustained by violence.

The regime’s response has included mass killings, arrests, and a deliberate shutdown of internet access to hide repression. Families cannot reach loved ones. The world cannot see what is happening.

For nearly half a century, this regime has fueled terrorism, nuclear escalation, and regional chaos at direct cost to U.S. interests. A democratic transition in Iran would fundamentally change the Middle East’s security landscape.

U.S. leadership matters. Public pressure, action to restore communications, and readiness to recognize a legitimate transitional authority can shorten the violence.

Delay only benefits those pulling the trigger.

Respectfully,
