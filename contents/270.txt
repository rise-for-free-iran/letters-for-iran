My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

The country is witnessing a nationwide uprising to end religious authoritarian rule.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I respectfully ask you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
