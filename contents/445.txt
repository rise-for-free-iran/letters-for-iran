My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
