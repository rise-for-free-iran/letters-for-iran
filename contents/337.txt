Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
