I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran is experiencing a historic confrontation between a population and a collapsing regime.

Millions across the country are demanding freedom. The regime has answered with mass killings, arrests, and a complete information blackout.

Internet connectivity has been nearly eliminated, preventing families from communicating and hiding violence from the world.

This government has long been responsible for terrorism, regional instability, and nuclear threats that endanger U.S. security. Its end would open the door to peace and cooperation.

Strong U.S. leadership—especially on accountability, communications access, and readiness for transition—can influence the outcome and save lives.

Silence strengthens the oppressor.

Respectfully,
_____
