My name is _____, and I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has crossed into a phase where outcomes are being decided daily.

This is not unrest or reform. It is the unraveling of a regime that survives only through force and isolation after losing public consent.

The government has answered with lethal violence, mass arrests, and a deliberate blackout of internet and communications to conceal repression.

For decades, this regime has been a source of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear risk, and threats to global energy security. Its survival has harmed U.S. interests repeatedly.

Clear U.S. leadership now can reduce bloodshed and influence a more stable transition.

Iran is changing. The response today will shape tomorrow.

Sincerely,
