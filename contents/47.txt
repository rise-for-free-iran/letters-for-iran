Millions of Iranians across the country have risen up. The regime's response: mass killings (12,000+ in 48 hours), a total internet blackout, and foreign mercenaries hunting protesters.

This isn't about humanitarian concern alone. A free Iran transforms U.S. strategic interests:
- Eliminates terrorism funding at the source
- Creates a powerful regional ally
- Ends nuclear threats
- Stabilizes global energy markets

Support breaking the information blackout, target IRGC leadership, and commit to recognizing a democratic government.

The opportunity won't last. Act now.
