I am _____, writing as an Iranian living in the United States because Iran’s crisis has reached a moment where hesitation carries real consequences.

Millions across Iran are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic. This is a nationwide movement sustained despite killings and mass arrests.

The government has imposed a near-total communications blackout while security forces attack civilians and the wounded.

This regime’s survival has long undermined U.S. interests through terrorism, regional instability, and nuclear threats.

Clear U.S. action—breaking the blackout, holding perpetrators accountable, and preparing to recognize a legitimate transition—can reduce bloodshed.

Silence will be felt inside Iran.

Sincerely,
_____
