My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I respectfully ask you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
