I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because Iran’s crisis now carries direct moral and strategic implications for the United States.

Millions of Iranians are risking their lives to overthrow a theocratic regime. The response has been mass killing, arrests, and a deliberate blackout to hide atrocities.

This regime has long exported terror and instability at direct cost to U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. action—economic pressure, technological intervention to restore communications, and readiness to recognize a democratic transition—can shorten the violence and save lives.

History will judge this moment.

Respectfully,
