I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American because Iran has reached a moment where international signals matter immediately.

Across hundreds of cities, millions of people are demanding the end of clerical rule. This is a nationwide rejection of the Islamic Republic despite extraordinary risk.

The regime’s response has been lethal force, mass arrests, targeting of the wounded, and a near-total communications blackout to hide evidence of violence.

This regime’s survival has long harmed U.S. interests through terrorism, regional conflict, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy security.

U.S. leadership now—publicly confronting violence, restoring access to information, and preparing to recognize a transitional government—can save lives and shape a more stable future.

Delay benefits only those using violence.

Sincerely,
