I am _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing to urge your attention to the crisis unfolding in Iran.

1) What is happening
Millions of Iranians across the country are demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This is a nationwide rejection of the regime, not a call for reform.

2) The regime’s response
The government is killing civilians, arresting thousands, and enforcing a near-total internet and communications blackout to conceal its actions.

3) Why this matters to the U.S.
For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear ambitions. Its collapse would remove a major source of regional and global instability.

4) What U.S. leadership can do now
Clear public action matters. I urge support for steps that weaken those directing violence, break the information blackout, and prepare the United States to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the Iranian people establish one.

Iran is approaching a turning point. U.S. clarity now can help save lives and shape a more stable future.

Sincerely,
