Dear Senator,

My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
