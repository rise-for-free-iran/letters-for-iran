I am _____, writing as an Iranian living in the United States, because Iran has entered a moment where delay itself becomes a decision.

This is not a political dispute. It is the collapse of a regime that has lost legitimacy and now governs through violence and isolation. Millions of Iranians are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic.

The state’s response has been killings, mass arrests, and a coordinated shutdown of internet and communications to hide repression.

For decades, this regime has fueled terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened energy security, and driven nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. positioning now can shorten the violence and shape what follows. Silence will only increase the toll.

Iran is moving forward. U.S. leadership can still matter.

Sincerely,
