Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I respectfully ask you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
