I am _____, an Iranian-American constituent, writing because Iran’s crisis has entered a dangerous and decisive stage.

Millions of Iranians are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic. This is a nationwide rejection of the regime, not a call for reform.

The government has responded with mass killings, arrests, and a near-total communications blackout to hide repression.

For decades, this regime has undermined regional stability, global energy security, and U.S. interests through terrorism and nuclear escalation.

Public U.S. action now—weakening those directing violence, restoring communications, and preparing to recognize a legitimate transitional government—can save lives.

Iran is at a turning point. Delay has consequences.

Sincerely,
