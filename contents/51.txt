I am _____, an Iranian-American writing about the crisis in Iran.

The Islamic Republic is finished. Millions are demanding its end across hundreds of cities. What happens next depends partly on whether the U.S. signals clarity or hesitation.

The regime's response—12,000+ killed in 48 hours, total internet shutdown—shows desperation, not strength.

America should:
1. Break the information blackout (Starlink)
2. Sanction IRGC leadership
3. Commit to recognizing a democratic government

A free Iran ends decades of terrorism, creates a powerful ally, and stabilizes the region. Clear U.S. leadership now shapes how this unfolds.

Please introduce supporting legislation immediately.
