My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
