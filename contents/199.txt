My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
