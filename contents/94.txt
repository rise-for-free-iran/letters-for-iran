I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because the situation in Iran demands urgent clarity from the United States.

Millions across Iran are confronting a regime that has lost legitimacy and now rules through violence and censorship. The response has been mass killings and a complete digital blackout.

Families are cut off. Evidence is disappearing. Lives are being lost without witnesses.

This regime has spent decades threatening regional stability, global energy security, and U.S. interests through terrorism and nuclear ambitions.

U.S. leadership—publicly supporting the Iranian people, restoring communications, and preparing for a democratic transition—can save lives and shape a safer future.

Every day without action strengthens repression.

Respectfully,
