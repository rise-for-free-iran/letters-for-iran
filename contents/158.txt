My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
