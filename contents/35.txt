I am _____. As an Iranian living in America, I'm writing about the crisis in Iran where my people are fighting for freedom.

WHAT'S HAPPENING:
* Nationwide uprising demanding regime end
* 12,000+ massacred in 48 hours
* Total internet blackout—1% connectivity
* Wounded hunted in hospitals

STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY:
A democratic Iran ends 47 years of terrorism funding, nuclear threats, and regional chaos. Iran's 90 million educated, pro-American people become our natural ally.

CONCRETE ACTIONS:
* Deploy Starlink
* Freeze regime assets and dismantle oil smuggling
* Recognize transitional government

Please champion this publicly. History will remember who stood with freedom.

Respectfully,
_____
