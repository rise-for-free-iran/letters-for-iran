I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because Iran’s uprising now intersects directly with U.S. strategic interests.

Millions of Iranians are demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. The regime has responded with violence, arrests, and a sweeping internet shutdown to hide repression.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, fueled conflict, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear ambitions harmful to U.S. security.

Clear U.S. positioning now—public condemnation, support for restoring communications, and readiness to recognize a transitional government—can influence the outcome.

Iran is moving toward change. The question is how violent that change becomes.

Sincerely,
_____
