I am _____, an Iranian in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a strategic inflection point.

This is not a protest movement seeking concessions. It is the breakdown of a governing system that no longer commands legitimacy and now survives through repression and isolation.

The regime’s response has been lethal force, mass arrests, and a nationwide shutdown of internet and communications to conceal violence. These are the actions of a regime acting out of fear.

For decades, the Islamic Republic has undermined regional stability, threatened energy security, advanced nuclear risk, and exported terrorism. Its survival has repeatedly damaged U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. positioning now can help shorten the violence and influence a more stable transition. Ambiguity will do the opposite.

Iran is moving toward change. U.S. clarity will matter.

Sincerely,
