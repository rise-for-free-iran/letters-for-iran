I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian who believes this moment in Iran will define the next generation.

This is not unrest or a policy dispute. It is the collapse of a governing system that has lost legitimacy and now relies almost entirely on violence and isolation.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

This regime’s survival has consistently undermined U.S. security interests and those of its allies across the region.

Ambiguity prolongs repression. Clear leadership can save lives and influence the course of what comes next.

Sincerely,
_____
