I'm _____, writing urgently about Iran.

Right now: Millions fighting regime across hundreds of cities. 12,000+ dead in 48 hours. Total communications blackout.

The strategic picture: Islamic Republic has destabilized Middle East for 47 years through terrorism, nuclear pursuit, proxy wars. Iranian people are ending this threat themselves.

What they need: Communications (Starlink), economic pressure (sanctions/asset freezes), U.S. commitment to democratic transition.

What America gains: Strongest regional ally, end of decades-long threats, transformation of Middle East security.

This moment is rare. U.S. action now determines whether transition is quick and stable or prolonged and chaotic.

Please introduce supporting legislation immediately.
