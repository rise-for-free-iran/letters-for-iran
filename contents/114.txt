I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian-American witnessing the silencing of an entire nation.

Millions across Iran are demanding freedom. The regime has responded with mass killings, arrests, and censorship.

Internet access has been reduced to almost nothing, isolating Iranians from one another and from the world.

For decades, this regime has destabilized the region and threatened U.S. interests. Supporting a transition away from it is both a moral and strategic imperative.

Targeted U.S. leadership now—breaking the information blockade and preparing for a legitimate transition—can save lives.

Silence enables violence.

Respectfully,
