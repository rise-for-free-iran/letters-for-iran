I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran is at a point where outside signals can still affect outcomes.

Millions across Iran are no longer calling for reform but for an end to the Islamic Republic. This movement persists despite lethal repression.

The regime has responded with shootings, mass arrests, and a deliberate communications blackout to hide its actions and suppress coordination.

For over four decades, this regime has been a driver of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy routes. Its continuation harms U.S. interests. Its removal would reshape the region.

Clear U.S. leadership now can help limit bloodshed and guide a more stable transition.

Iran is changing regardless. The cost of that change is not fixed.

Sincerely,
