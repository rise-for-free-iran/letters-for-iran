I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran is entering a transition phase without international preparation.

Millions of people are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic despite lethal repression.

The regime has imposed a communications blackout while carrying out killings and mass arrests.

For decades, this government has been a driver of terrorism, regional chaos, and nuclear risk that threatens U.S. interests.

U.S. clarity now—challenging the blackout and preparing to recognize a post-regime transition—can reduce bloodshed.

The cost of ambiguity is rising.

Sincerely,
_____
