As an Iranian-American constituent, I'm writing about the situation in Iran and what it means for U.S. interests.

The Islamic Republic is facing nationwide rejection. Millions are in the streets. The regime's killing civilians—12,000+ in two days—and has imposed total communications blackout.

From a U.S. strategic perspective, this is transformational. The regime has been our primary adversary for decades. Its end means:
- Terrorism funding stops
- Nuclear threat ends
- Regional stability increases
- 90 million potential allies

Support: Breaking information blackout, sanctioning regime leaders, recognizing democratic government.

This is happening whether we're ready or not. U.S. leadership determines the outcome.

Act now.
