Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

Iranians have been isolated through shutdowns of mobile and online networks.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
