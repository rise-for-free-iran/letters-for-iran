Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
