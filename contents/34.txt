My name is _____. I am an Iranian-American constituent urging immediate action on Iran.

Iran has reached a decisive moment. Millions are fighting to overthrow a regime that has ruled through terror for over four decades. The response: lethal force, mass arrests, internet shutdown.

This directly affects U.S. security. The Islamic Republic exports terrorism, destabilizes the region, and pursues nuclear ambitions. Its removal would be a strategic game-changer.

I urge you to:
* Support breaking the information blackout
* Take concrete steps against those directing violence
* Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government

Iran is changing regardless. U.S. leadership determines whether that change saves lives or unfolds through chaos.

Thank you,
_____
