My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the U.S., writing because Iran is moving toward change regardless—U.S. leadership influences how costly that becomes.

Millions across Iran openly demand regime end despite severe risks. Security forces kill unarmed civilians, arrest thousands, target wounded. Near-total internet blackout prevents coordination and hides mass violence.

This regime has repeatedly undermined U.S. interests, endangered allies, fueled Middle East conflict. Its survival perpetuates these harms.

WHAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE:
* Public steps against violence directors
* Actively supporting blackout-breaking
* Preparing transitional government recognition

Clear positions shorten violence. Ambiguity prolongs bloodshed.

Sincerely,
_____
