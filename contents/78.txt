I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because events in Iran are accelerating faster than the world’s response.

What is taking place is not unrest but regime failure. Having lost legitimacy, the Islamic Republic now relies on violence and isolation to survive. Millions of Iranians are openly rejecting it despite severe danger.

The state has answered with killings, arrests, and an engineered communications blackout designed to hide repression and silence witnesses.

For decades, this regime has been a central source of terrorism, regional chaos, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy security. Its persistence has repeatedly harmed U.S. interests.

Clear leadership from the United States—especially now—can reduce bloodshed and help shape what follows. Silence will only extend the crisis.

Iran is moving toward change whether the world acts or not. U.S. leadership can still influence the cost.

Sincerely,
