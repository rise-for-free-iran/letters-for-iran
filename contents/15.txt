As an Iranian living in the United States, I am writing to underscore that Iran is at a decisive crossroads.

This is not unrest or a policy dispute. It is the collapse of a governing system that has lost legitimacy and now relies almost entirely on violence and isolation.

The regime’s response has been lethal: shootings in the streets, mass arrests, targeted violence against the wounded, and a deliberate shutdown of internet and communications to hide its actions.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Public clarity from the United States can change calculations inside Iran and help reduce bloodshed during an inevitable transition.

Sincerely,
