I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American constituent about the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Iran.

Millions of Iranians have risen demanding an end to theocratic rule. The regime has responded with mass killings, arrests, and the use of overwhelming force against civilians.

Hospitals, streets, and homes have become sites of violence. Bodies are hidden. Families are silenced.

Iran is also under near-total digital blackout, preventing communication and accountability.

The United States can act decisively—weakening the regime’s killing capacity, restoring internet access, and preparing to recognize a legitimate transitional government.

A free Iran would align with American values and interests.

Respectfully,
