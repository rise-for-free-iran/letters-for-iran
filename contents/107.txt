I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because Iran’s freedom movement has entered a catastrophic phase.

Millions are demanding democratic rights and an end to religious rule. The response has been mass executions, arrests, and systematic efforts to hide the scale of violence.

Internet access has been reduced to a fraction of normal levels, preventing communication and allowing atrocities to continue unseen.

For decades, this regime has exported terror, destabilized the Middle East, and threatened global energy security. Supporting a transition away from it aligns with both American values and U.S. interests.

Targeted U.S. action—weakening the regime’s killing apparatus, breaking the digital blockade, and preparing to recognize a transitional government—can save lives and shape a better future.

History will remember who acted.

Respectfully,
