I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian-American who cannot reach family inside Iran.

Millions across Iran are risking their lives to end decades of theocratic rule. The regime has responded with mass killings, arrests, and terror.

Hospitals have become execution sites. Bodies are buried without names. Families are silenced.

Now, the government has imposed a near-total internet blackout. We are blind to what is happening, and they are isolated from the world.

The United States can help by taking targeted steps to reduce the regime’s capacity for violence, restore communication, and prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional authority.

A free Iran would be a partner for peace, not a source of instability.

Respectfully,
