I am _____, writing about Iran where millions are fighting for freedom.

The regime has killed over 12,000 people in 48 hours and imposed total communications blackout. They're desperate because they've lost legitimacy.

Here's what the U.S. should understand: This regime has been the engine of Middle East chaos—terrorism, nuclear threats, proxy wars—for nearly 50 years. Its removal transforms everything.

The Iranian people need targeted support: internet access, economic pressure on regime, recognition of democratic transition.

In exchange, America gets a natural ally of 90 million educated people in the world's most strategic region.

This is the easiest strategic decision imaginable. Please make it.
