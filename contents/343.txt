Dear Senator,

My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
