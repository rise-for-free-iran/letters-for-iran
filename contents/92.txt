I am _____, an Iranian-American constituent, writing because Iran’s freedom movement has entered a critical and deadly phase.

Millions of Iranians have risen across the country. The regime has responded with mass executions, arrests, and a near-total digital blackout.

Families are unable to reach one another. Evidence of atrocities is being erased in real time.

For nearly 50 years, this regime has been a driver of terrorism, nuclear risk, and regional instability harmful to U.S. interests. Its fall would change the region for the better.

The United States can help by standing publicly with the Iranian people, restoring communications, and preparing to recognize a legitimate transitional authority.

Delay costs lives.

Respectfully,
