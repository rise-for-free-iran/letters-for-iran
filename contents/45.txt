My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
