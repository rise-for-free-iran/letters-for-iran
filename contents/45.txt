I am _____. As an Iranian-American, I'm writing about a crisis demanding U.S. action.

Iran faces regime breakdown: millions rejecting Islamic Republic in hundreds of cities. Government response—lethal force, mass detention, communications shutdown—reflects fear, not control.

THE BIGGER PICTURE:
* 47 years of exported terrorism
* Regional instability driver
* Nuclear threat
* Energy route endangerment

FREE IRAN MEANS:
* End of proxy wars
* Natural U.S. alliance
* Economic integration
* Regional stability transformation

NEEDED NOW: Starlink, IRGC targeting, asset freezes, diplomatic expulsion, transitional government recognition.

Please act immediately.
