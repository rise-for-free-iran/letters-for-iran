My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

The country is witnessing a nationwide uprising to end religious authoritarian rule.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Only global attention can help protect lives now.

Sincerely,
_____
