I'm an Iranian living in America. My people are being slaughtered for demanding what we take for granted: freedom, democracy, and human dignity.

The numbers are staggering—12,000 dead in two days. The regime has shut down the internet so the world can't see. They're hunting wounded people in hospitals.

But here's what matters to American interests: this regime has terrorized the region for decades. Its collapse ends that threat and creates a democratic ally of 90 million people who love America.

They need minimal help: communications tools, economic pressure, and our commitment to recognize their future government.

Don't let this moment pass.
