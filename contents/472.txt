Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

Iranians have been isolated through shutdowns of mobile and online networks.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
