I am _____, an Iranian-American constituent. My family in Tehran hasn't answered calls in over a week. The regime has shut down the internet to hide what they're doing.

Millions are in the streets demanding freedom. Over 12,000 have been killed in 48 hours. This isn't a protest—it's the end of a 47-year nightmare that has funded Hezbollah, threatened nuclear war, and destabilized the entire Middle East.

The Iranian people are ending this themselves. They need Starlink to communicate, economic pressure on the regime, and U.S. recognition of a transitional government when they succeed.

This is America's chance to gain a natural ally of 90 million educated, pro-American people. Please support them now.

Respectfully,
