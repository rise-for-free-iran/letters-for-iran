My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am writing to urgently call your attention to the crisis unfolding in Iran.

Millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities have risen up demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This is a nationwide movement to overthrow a regime that has ruled through violence and repression for more than four decades.

The regime has responded with mass killings, widespread arrests, and the targeting of wounded protesters, even inside hospitals. At the same time, it has imposed a near-total internet and communications blackout to hide these crimes from the world.

This crisis directly affects U.S. interests. For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear ambitions that endanger international security. Its collapse would mark a major step toward regional and global stability.

I respectfully urge you to:

* Take public and concrete steps to protect Iranian civilians by weakening the regime’s repressive capacity and targeting those directing violence
* Support efforts to break the regime’s information blackout by enabling unrestricted internet access and secure communications
* Prepare the United States to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the Iranian people establish one

The Iranian people are risking their lives for freedom. Clear and timely action from the United States can save lives and help bring an end to one of the world’s most destabilizing regimes.

Please act now.

Sincerely,
