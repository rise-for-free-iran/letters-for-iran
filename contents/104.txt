I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran stands at the edge of irreversible change.

Millions across the country are rejecting the Islamic Republic despite lethal repression. This is a nationwide demand for the regime’s end.

The government has answered with mass killings, arrests, and a near-total shutdown of communications to hide the truth.

This regime has long threatened regional stability, global energy security, and U.S. interests through terrorism and nuclear ambitions.

Clear U.S. positioning—breaking the information blackout, weakening those directing violence, and preparing to recognize a transitional government—can reduce bloodshed.

Iran is approaching a turning point. Leadership now will shape the future.

Sincerely,
