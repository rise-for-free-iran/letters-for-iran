I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian who believes this moment in Iran will define the next generation.

The scale and persistence of this movement make clear that the regime no longer governs by consent, but by coercion alone.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Public clarity from the United States can change calculations inside Iran and help reduce bloodshed during an inevitable transition.

Sincerely,
