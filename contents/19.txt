I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a point where delay itself has consequences.

What began as resistance has become a nationwide break with a regime sustained only by force, censorship, and fear.

Violence, arrests, and an engineered information blackout now define the state’s response—measures that signal fear, not strength.

The Islamic Republic has long been a central driver of regional instability, proxy warfare, nuclear risk, and global energy insecurity.

Ambiguity prolongs repression. Clear leadership can save lives and influence the course of what comes next.

Sincerely,
_____
