I am _____, an Iranian-American living in the United States, writing because Iran has entered a moment of extraordinary danger.

Millions are demanding democratic freedoms and an end to the Islamic Republic. The regime has answered with mass murder, arrests, and terror.

Internet connectivity has collapsed, leaving Iranians unable to communicate or show the world what is happening.

This same regime has destabilized the Middle East for decades and remains a threat to U.S. security.

Targeted U.S. leadership—economic, technological, and diplomatic—can help protect civilians and prepare for a legitimate transition of power.

The cost of hesitation is measured in lives.

Respectfully,
