I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran stands at a breaking point.

Millions of citizens are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic despite the threat of lethal repression. This is not a temporary uprising but a decisive break.

The regime has responded with killings, mass arrests, and a nationwide communications blackout to hide its actions and silence witnesses.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the region, threatened global energy security, and advanced nuclear escalation. Its persistence undermines U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. positioning now can shorten the violence and influence the transition ahead.

Iran is moving forward. Leadership now matters.

Sincerely,
