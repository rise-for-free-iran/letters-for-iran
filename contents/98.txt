I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American because the crisis in Iran now demands clear international positioning.

This is not a reform movement. Millions across Iran are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic after decades of repression.

The regime has responded with killings, arrests, and a sweeping shutdown of internet and communications to suppress coordination and hide repression.

This government has long exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy markets, and pursued nuclear escalation—directly harming U.S. interests.

U.S. leadership now—weakening those ordering violence, breaking the information blackout, and preparing to recognize a legitimate transitional government—can reduce bloodshed.

Iran stands at a turning point. Silence will shape the outcome as much as action.

Sincerely,
