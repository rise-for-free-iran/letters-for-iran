My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

The country is witnessing a nationwide uprising to end religious authoritarian rule.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
