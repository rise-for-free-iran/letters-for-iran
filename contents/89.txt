I am _____, an Iranian-American constituent, writing because Iran has reached a point where international response directly affects survival.

Millions are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic. The regime has responded by killing civilians, imprisoning thousands, and shutting down communications to hide its actions.

Families cannot locate loved ones. The world cannot verify the scale of the atrocities.

For decades, this regime has undermined regional and global security through terrorism, nuclear escalation, and destabilization. Its collapse would remove a central threat to U.S. interests.

The United States should act decisively—stand publicly with the Iranian people, help restore communications, and prepare to recognize a democratic transition.

Every day of hesitation costs lives.

Respectfully,
