As an Iranian living in the United States, I am writing to underscore that Iran is at a decisive crossroads.

What began as resistance has become a nationwide break with a regime sustained only by force, censorship, and fear.

The regime’s response has been lethal: shootings in the streets, mass arrests, targeted violence against the wounded, and a deliberate shutdown of internet and communications to hide its actions.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. leadership now will help determine whether that change is shorter and less violent, or prolonged and chaotic.

Sincerely,
