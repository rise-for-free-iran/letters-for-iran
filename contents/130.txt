I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian alarmed by how quickly events in Iran are unfolding.

This is not a protest cycle. Millions of Iranians are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic itself.

The regime’s response has been mass killings, arrests, and an intentional internet blackout to hide repression.

For decades, this government has destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy security, and pursued nuclear escalation at cost to U.S. interests.

Public U.S. leadership now—challenging the blackout and preparing for transition—can save lives and shape a more stable outcome.

Hesitation will extend the violence.

Sincerely,
