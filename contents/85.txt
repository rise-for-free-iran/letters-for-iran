I am _____, an Iranian-American living in the United States, writing because the situation in Iran has crossed from crisis into catastrophe.

Millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities are no longer asking for reform. They are risking their lives to dismantle a system that has ruled through fear for decades. The regime has answered with mass killing, arrests, and terror.

Reports from inside Iran describe civilians shot in the streets, wounded protesters executed in hospitals, and victims buried in mass graves. At the same time, the government has imposed a near-total digital blackout, cutting families off from one another and hiding the scale of the violence.

This regime has spent decades exporting terrorism, destabilizing the Middle East, and threatening global security, including U.S. interests. Its collapse would remove a major source of regional instability.

The United States has leverage. Clear public action—supporting accountability, breaking the information blackout, and preparing to engage a transitional government—can save lives and shape what comes next.

Silence carries a cost measured in human lives.

Respectfully,
