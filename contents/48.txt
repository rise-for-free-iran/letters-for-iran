I am _____, writing as an American-Iranian.

What's happening in Iran right now will reshape the Middle East. Millions are fighting to overthrow the regime. The question is whether America will help shape a stable transition or watch chaos unfold.

The regime has killed over 12,000 in 48 hours and cut off all internet. They're terrified because they know they're finished.

Iran needs: Starlink, asset freezes, IRGC sanctions, and U.S. commitment to a democratic transition.

A free Iran means no more Hezbollah, no more nuclear threats, and a natural U.S. ally with massive resources. This is the biggest strategic opportunity in a generation.

Please champion this cause.
