I am _____, writing about Iran.

Right now, millions are fighting for freedom against one of the world's most brutal regimes. Over 12,000 have been killed in two days. The internet is completely shut down.

The United States can help shape this transition or watch it unfold chaotically. The Iranian people need communications tools, economic pressure on the regime, and our commitment to their democratic future.

In return, America gets an ally of 90 million people, ends decades of terrorism and nuclear threats, and transforms Middle East security.

This is straightforward strategic thinking. Please act on it.
