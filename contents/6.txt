I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing to bring urgent attention to the situation in Iran and to explain why U.S. action at this moment matters.

1) What is happening in Iran right now

Millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities and towns are openly demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

This is not a reform movement or a limited protest; it is a nationwide rejection of the regime itself.

The movement continues despite extreme levels of violence.

2) How the regime is responding

Security forces are killing unarmed civilians in the streets and arresting thousands.

Wounded protesters have been targeted, including inside hospitals.

The government has imposed a near-total internet and communications blackout to prevent coordination and to hide evidence of mass violence.

3) Why this matters to the United States

For over four decades, this regime has been a major source of regional instability, exporting terrorism, threatening global energy routes, and pursuing nuclear ambitions.

Its survival has repeatedly undermined U.S. interests, endangered allies, and fueled conflict across the Middle East.

Its collapse would remove one of the most persistent drivers of instability and open the door to a fundamentally different regional dynamic.

4) Why timing matters

The Iranian people are already taking enormous risks.

What happens next will be influenced by whether international actors—especially the United States—signal clarity or hesitation.

Clear positions can shorten the violence and shape a more stable transition; ambiguity prolongs repression and bloodshed.

5) Actions that would make a real difference

I urge the United States to:

Take public and concrete steps against those directing violence against Iranian civilians

Actively support efforts to break the regime’s information blackout and restore internet access

Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the Iranian people establish one

Iran is moving toward a transition whether the world is ready or not. U.S. leadership now can help determine whether that transition saves lives and advances stability—or unfolds through prolonged violence and chaos.

Thank you for your attention at this critical moment.

Sincerely,
