I am _____, Iranian-American.

Iran is at a turning point. The Islamic Republic is collapsing under a nationwide uprising. Millions demand freedom despite brutal repression—12,000+ killed in two days, total internet shutdown.

For U.S. policy, this is transformational:
- Ends 47 years of terrorism funding
- Removes nuclear threat
- Creates democratic ally with vast resources
- Stabilizes the region

Actions: Deploy Starlink, sanction IRGC leaders, recognize transitional government.

The Iranian people are fighting for values we share. Clear U.S. support shortens the violence and shapes stable outcomes.
