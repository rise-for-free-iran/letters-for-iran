My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

Iranians have been isolated through shutdowns of mobile and online networks.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
