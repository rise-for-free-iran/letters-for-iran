I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran stands at a turning point with global implications.

Millions of people across the country are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic. This is a decisive break with a regime that now governs only through force.

The government has imposed a nationwide communications blackout while killing civilians and arresting thousands.

This regime has long been a source of terrorism, regional instability, and nuclear escalation that harms U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. signals—public accountability, opposition to information blackouts, and preparation for a transitional government—can help shorten the violence.

Iran is approaching transition whether the world prepares or not.

Sincerely,
