I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a moment where external clarity can still influence events.

Millions of citizens are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic. This is not unrest or reform but a nationwide demand for the regime’s end.

The government has responded with lethal force, mass arrests, and a near-total communications blackout to conceal violence.

For decades, this regime has fueled terrorism, regional conflict, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy security. Its survival has undermined U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. leadership—on accountability, restoring information access, and readiness for a post-regime transition—can shorten the violence and shape a more stable future.

Iran is moving quickly. The cost of delay is rising.

Sincerely,
