My name is _____. I'm Iranian-American, and I'm watching my homeland transform.

The Islamic Republic is dying. Millions are in the streets demanding freedom. The regime's response—mass killings, communications blackout—proves they've lost.

This is about more than humanitarian concern. For 47 years, this regime has been America's primary regional threat. Its end means:
- No more Hezbollah funding
- No more nuclear escalation
- A natural democratic ally in the Middle East's heart

Support breaking the information blackout and sanctioning regime leaders. Commit to recognizing a democratic Iran.

This opportunity comes once in a lifetime. Don't waste it.
