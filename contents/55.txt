My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

Iranians have been isolated through shutdowns of mobile and online networks.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
