Dear Senator,

My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
