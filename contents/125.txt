I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a moment where international response will directly affect how much blood is shed.

This is not a cycle of protests or calls for reform. Millions of Iranians are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic itself, despite lethal consequences.

The regime has responded with killings, mass arrests, and a nationwide shutdown of internet and communications. This blackout is intentional—designed to hide repression and prevent coordination.

For the United States, this moment goes beyond humanitarian concern. The Islamic Republic has long fueled terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation. Its collapse would remove a major source of global insecurity.

Clear U.S. signals now—accountability for violence, resistance to information blackouts, and readiness for a post-regime transition—can shorten the violence.

Iran is moving forward regardless. U.S. leadership will shape the cost.

Sincerely,
