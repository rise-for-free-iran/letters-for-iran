My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

Iranians have been isolated through shutdowns of mobile and online networks.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
