I am an Iranian living in the United States. Iran has reached a decisive moment requiring U.S. response.

Millions in cities and towns are openly confronting the Islamic Republic—a nationwide rejection sustained through violence. The government uses live fire, mass arrests, targets wounded, and enforces total communications blackout.

This crisis affects U.S. interests: The regime has fueled instability, terrorism, nuclear threats for decades. Its removal fundamentally alters the strategic landscape.

I urge:
* Clear action isolating and weakening those directing violence
* Breaking the information blackout
* Preparing to recognize transitional government

Iranians are doing the hard part. They need U.S. clarity.

Thank you,
