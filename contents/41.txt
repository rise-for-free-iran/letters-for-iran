Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Only global attention can help protect lives now.

Sincerely,
_____
