I am _____, an Iranian in the United States, writing because what happens in Iran now will echo far beyond its borders.

The scale and persistence of this movement make clear that the regime no longer governs by consent, but by coercion alone.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

This regime’s survival has consistently undermined U.S. security interests and those of its allies across the region.

Ambiguity prolongs repression. Clear leadership can save lives and influence the course of what comes next.

Sincerely,
