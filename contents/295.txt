Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
