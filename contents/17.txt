I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a point where delay itself has consequences.

Across the country, millions of people are no longer demanding reforms. They are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright, even as the risks grow more severe by the day.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

The Islamic Republic has long been a central driver of regional instability, proxy warfare, nuclear risk, and global energy insecurity.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. leadership now will help determine whether that change is shorter and less violent, or prolonged and chaotic.

Sincerely,
_____
