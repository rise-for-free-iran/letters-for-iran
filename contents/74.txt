My name is _____, and I'm Iranian-American. My family in Iran is unreachable—the regime has shut down all communications to hide mass killings.

Millions are fighting for freedom across the country. Over 12,000 have been killed in just two days.

This matters to America: The Islamic Republic has been our biggest Middle East problem for 47 years. The Iranian people are solving it. We should help them succeed quickly and transition to democracy.

Support: Starlink deployment, IRGC sanctions, recognition of democratic government.

Result: End of regional terrorism, nuclear threats, and decades of instability. Creation of a powerful democratic ally.

Please act immediately.
