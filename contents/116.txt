I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian concerned that Iran has entered a decisive and dangerous phase.

Millions across the country are openly demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This movement is not limited or symbolic—it is national in scope and sustained despite lethal repression.

Security forces have responded with shootings, mass arrests, and attacks on wounded protesters. At the same time, the government has shut down internet and communications to erase evidence and prevent coordination.

This regime has long undermined U.S. interests through terrorism, regional instability, threats to global energy security, and nuclear escalation.

Public U.S. positioning now—holding perpetrators accountable, supporting efforts to restore communications, and preparing for a post-regime transition—can reduce bloodshed and influence what follows.

Hesitation will only extend the violence.

Sincerely,
