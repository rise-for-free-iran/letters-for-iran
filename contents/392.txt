My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
