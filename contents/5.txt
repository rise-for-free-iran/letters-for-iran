I am _____. I am writing as an Iranian-American constituent about the crisis unfolding in Iran, where millions of my compatriots are fighting for the democratic freedoms we cherish in America.
Since late December, millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities have risen up demanding an end to 47 years of theocratic tyranny. The regime's response has been catastrophic: over 12,000 people massacred in the first 48 hours alone—one murder every 14 seconds. Security forces and foreign mercenaries are gunning down peaceful protesters, hunting the wounded in hospitals, and burying victims in unmarked mass graves.

For over a week, Iran has been under complete digital blackout with internet connectivity at 1% of normal levels. The Iranian people cannot communicate, organize, or tell the world what is happening. We cannot reach our families.

These brave people are fighting and dying for freedom. They need targeted U.S. support:
* Degrade the regime's killing capacity by targeting IRGC leadership and infrastructure
* Apply maximum economic pressure by blocking regime assets and dismantling their oil smuggling operations
* Break the information blockade by deploying Starlink and disabling the regime's internet controls
* Prepare to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the regime falls

The Iranian people love America and are fighting for separation of religion and state, individual liberty, and democratic governance. A free Iran will be one of America's strongest allies in the Middle East.
Senator, history will judge how we respond. Please use your voice to champion their cause—introduce or co-sponsor supporting legislation, press the Administration for action, and stand publicly with those fighting tyranny.

Every day of inaction means more lives lost.

Respectfully,
