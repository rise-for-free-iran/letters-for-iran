My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
