I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a point where delay itself has consequences.

Across the country, millions of people are no longer demanding reforms. They are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright, even as the risks grow more severe by the day.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

This regime’s survival has consistently undermined U.S. security interests and those of its allies across the region.

Ambiguity prolongs repression. Clear leadership can save lives and influence the course of what comes next.

Sincerely,
_____
