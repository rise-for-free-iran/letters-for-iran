My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I respectfully ask you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
