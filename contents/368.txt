Dear Senator,

My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
