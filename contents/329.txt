Dear Senator,

My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I respectfully ask you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
