I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian who believes this moment in Iran will define the next generation.

The scale and persistence of this movement make clear that the regime no longer governs by consent, but by coercion alone.

Violence, arrests, and an engineered information blackout now define the state’s response—measures that signal fear, not strength.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. positioning now—on accountability for violence, challenging information blackouts, and readiness for a post-regime transition—can shorten the violence and shape a more stable outcome.

Sincerely,
