I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American deeply concerned by the speed and scale of violence in Iran.

Millions have risen across hundreds of cities demanding freedom. The response has been catastrophic: mass killings, arrests, and systematic repression.

Security forces and allied militias are attacking civilians while the government enforces a near-total internet blackout to hide the crimes.

This regime has long been a source of terrorism and instability that harms U.S. interests. Its end would transform the region for the better.

The United States should act now—by degrading the regime’s capacity for violence, breaking the information blockade, and preparing for a democratic transition.

Lives are being lost while the world waits.

Respectfully,
