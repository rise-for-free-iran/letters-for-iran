Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

The country is witnessing a nationwide uprising to end religious authoritarian rule.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
