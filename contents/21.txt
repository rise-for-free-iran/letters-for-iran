I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because events in Iran are accelerating faster than the world’s response.

This is not unrest or a policy dispute. It is the collapse of a governing system that has lost legitimacy and now relies almost entirely on violence and isolation.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

The Islamic Republic has long been a central driver of regional instability, proxy warfare, nuclear risk, and global energy insecurity.

Public clarity from the United States can change calculations inside Iran and help reduce bloodshed during an inevitable transition.

Sincerely,
