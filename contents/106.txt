I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American constituent alarmed by the scale of atrocities unfolding in Iran.

Since late December, millions of Iranians have risen across the country demanding an end to clerical rule. The regime has answered with extraordinary brutality—thousands killed in days, civilians hunted in the streets, and families forced to search for loved ones in mass graves.

Iran is now under near-total digital blackout. Communication has been severed, evidence erased, and families left without news.

This regime has long threatened U.S. interests through terrorism, regional instability, and nuclear escalation. Its collapse would remove a major source of global insecurity.

U.S. leadership—targeting those directing violence, applying economic pressure, restoring communications, and preparing to recognize a transitional authority—can shorten the bloodshed.

Every day of delay costs lives.

Respectfully,
