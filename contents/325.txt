Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
