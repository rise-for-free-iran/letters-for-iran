My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
