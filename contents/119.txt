I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran’s uprising has entered a critical phase.

Millions across the country are openly demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This is not a protest seeking concessions but a population rejecting the regime itself.

Security forces have responded with shootings, arrests, and the deliberate shutdown of internet and communications to suppress coordination and hide atrocities.

For over forty years, this regime has destabilized the region, exported terrorism, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation at the expense of U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. leadership now—accountability for violence, support for restoring communications, and readiness for a transitional government—can shorten the violence.

Iran is moving forward. U.S. clarity will matter.

Sincerely,
