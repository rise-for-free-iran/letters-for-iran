I am _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing to urge your attention to the crisis unfolding in Iran.

RIGHT NOW, AS I WRITE THIS:
* Millions of Iranians are in the streets of hundreds of cities, risking everything for freedom
* Over 12,000 have been massacred in 48 hours—one every 14 seconds
* Iran has been under total internet blackout for over a week—we cannot reach our families
* The regime is using foreign mercenaries to hunt and execute peaceful protesters

THIS IS NOT JUST A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS—IT'S A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICA.

For 47 years, the Islamic Republic has been America's most destabilizing adversary in the Middle East: funding terrorism, pursuing nuclear weapons, threatening Israel, and chanting "Death to America." The Iranian people are about to end this threat themselves—they just need minimal support to finish the job.

WHAT A FREE IRAN MEANS FOR AMERICAN INTERESTS:
* End of regional terrorism: No more Hezbollah funding, no more proxy wars, no more nuclear threats
* Natural alliance: Iranians love America. After liberation, Iran becomes America's strongest Middle East partner
* Economic powerhouse: 90 million highly educated people (70% of engineers are women), vast oil and mineral resources, strategic location linking East and West
* Regional peace: Iran can join expanded Abraham Accords ("Cyrus Accords"), fundamentally transforming Middle East security

CONCRETE ACTIONS NEEDED NOW:
* Deploy Starlink to break the regime's information blackade
* Target IRGC leadership and freeze regime assets globally
* Expel Iranian regime diplomats
* Announce U.S. will recognize a democratic transitional government

THE ASK:
Senator, please champion this cause publicly. Introduce supporting legislation. Press the Administration to act. The window is now—the regime is collapsing, but every day of silence costs more Iranian lives and risks a chaotic transition.
History will remember who stood with freedom when it mattered most.

Urgently,
_____
