My name is _____, and I am an American-Iranian living in the US.
 
THE SITUATION:
--------------
Millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities are fighting to overthrow the Islamic Republic. The regime has massacred over 12,000 in just 48 hours. Iran is under total internet blackout—1% connectivity—preventing communication and hiding atrocities from the world.

WHY THIS MATTERS TO AMERICA:
----------------------------
The Islamic Republic has been our primary Middle East threat for 47 years: funding Hezbollah, pursuing nuclear weapons, destabilizing the region, exporting terrorism. The Iranian people are ending this threat themselves. We, as the US, should aid them in their historic journey.

A free, democratic Iran means:
* Security: End of terrorism funding, proxy wars, and nuclear threats
* Alliance: 90 million pro-American people becoming our strongest regional partner
* Economics: Highly educated workforce, vast resources, strategic trade location
* Regional peace: Iran joining expanded Abraham Accords transforms Middle East stability

WHAT THEY NEED FROM US:
-----------------------
* Commit to recognizing a democratic transitional government
* Deploy Starlink to break the information blackout
* Target IRGC leadership and freeze regime assets
* Dismantle regime's oil smuggling operations
* Expel Iranian regime diplomats

YOUR ACTION:
Please introduce or co-sponsor legislation supporting Iranian freedom fighters and press the Administration to act immediately. The regime is collapsing now—every delay costs lives and risks instability.

This is the biggest geopolitical opportunity in the Middle East in decades. Let's not miss it.

Respectfully,
