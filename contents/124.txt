I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian watching a decisive moment unfold in Iran.

Millions across hundreds of cities are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic. This is not reform—it is a nationwide demand for the regime’s end.

The state has answered with killings, mass arrests, attacks on the wounded, and a near-total internet blackout to erase evidence.

For over four decades, this regime has been a source of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy security—damaging U.S. interests.

U.S. leadership now—breaking the information blackout and preparing to recognize a legitimate transition—can save lives.

The cost of delay is rising.

Sincerely,
_____
