My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

The country is witnessing a nationwide uprising to end religious authoritarian rule.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I call on you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Only global attention can help protect lives now.

Sincerely,
_____
