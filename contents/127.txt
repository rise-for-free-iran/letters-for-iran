I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran is no longer approaching change—it is in the middle of it.

Millions of citizens are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic despite mass violence. This is a nationwide break, not a political dispute.

The regime has answered with killings, arrests, and a sweeping internet blackout designed to erase evidence and isolate the population.

For decades, this government has been a central driver of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear risk, and threats to global energy routes. Its survival has repeatedly harmed U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. leadership—especially now—can shorten the violence and shape a more stable transition.

Iran is moving regardless. The question is how costly that transition becomes.

Sincerely,
