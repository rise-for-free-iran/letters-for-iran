I am _____.

Iran is experiencing regime collapse in real time. Millions have taken to the streets. The government is killing civilians and has imposed a total blackout to hide it.

This matters to the United States because this regime has been the engine of Middle East chaos for 47 years. Remove it, and the strategic landscape transforms overnight.

The Iranian people aren't asking for troops or massive intervention. They need:
- Communications tools (Starlink)
- Economic pressure on the regime
- U.S. commitment to their democratic future

Every day of U.S. silence emboldens the regime and costs Iranian lives. Please act now.

Sincerely,
_____
