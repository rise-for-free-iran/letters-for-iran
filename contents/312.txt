My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
