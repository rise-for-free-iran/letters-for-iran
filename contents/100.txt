I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian watching Iran approach a historic rupture.

Millions across the country are no longer seeking reform but the complete end of the Islamic Republic.

The regime has answered with killings, mass arrests, and an intentional shutdown of internet and communications to hide repression.

This same regime has long destabilized the Middle East, exported terrorism, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear ambitions—at direct cost to U.S. interests.

U.S. clarity now—supporting accountability, breaking the blackout, and preparing to recognize a transitional authority—can reduce bloodshed and influence what follows.

Iran is nearing a decisive moment. U.S. leadership can still matter.

Sincerely,
