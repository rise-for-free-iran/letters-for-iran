I am an Iranian living in America. What's happening in Iran right now is historic—and urgent.

Millions across hundreds of cities are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic. The regime has killed over 12,000 in 48 hours and shut down all communications to hide it.

This regime has been the source of Middle East terrorism, nuclear threats, and instability for nearly 50 years. Its collapse removes all of that and creates a democratic ally.

The Iranian people need: internet access (Starlink), economic pressure on regime leaders, and U.S. recognition of democratic transition.

This is the clearest strategic win imaginable. Please champion it publicly and introduce supporting legislation.

Time matters.
