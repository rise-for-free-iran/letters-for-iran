I am an Iranian-American, _____, writing about Iran's historic moment.

Iran is not experiencing protests—it's experiencing regime breakdown. Millions are risking everything despite extreme violence. The regime has imposed total communications blackout to hide mass killings.

THE U.S. OPPORTUNITY:
* End of Middle East's primary destabilizing force
* 90 million potential allies with vast resources
* Transformation of regional security dynamics

WHAT'S NEEDED NOW:
* Starlink deployment
* IRGC leadership targeting
* Commitment to recognize democratic transition

This is the biggest geopolitical opportunity in decades. Please introduce supporting legislation and press the Administration.

Urgently,
_____
