My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
