My name is _____. I'm writing about Iran because how the U.S. responds shapes both the outcome and what follows.

Across Iran, millions openly reject the Islamic Republic—not a protest cycle but a nationwide break with a regime sustained only through violence. The government kills civilians, arrests thousands, imposes internet blackout.

THE STRATEGIC PICTURE:
This regime is the central source of regional instability, terrorism, threats to energy routes, nuclear escalation. Its collapse removes a persistent driver of Middle East insecurity.

WHAT MATTERS NOW:
Public signals that repression faces consequences, blackouts will be challenged, transition will be taken seriously—these shorten violence and save lives.

Please lead.
