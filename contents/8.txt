I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a decisive moment—and how the United States responds will have real consequences.

Across Iran, millions of people in cities and small towns are openly confronting the Islamic Republic. This is no longer a protest cycle or a reform effort. It is a nationwide rejection of a regime that governs through violence, fear, and isolation.

The government’s response has been extreme: live fire against civilians, mass arrests, and the systematic targeting of the wounded. To conceal these actions, authorities have shut down internet and communications nationwide, attempting to erase evidence and silence the population.

This crisis is not distant from U.S. interests. For decades, the Islamic Republic has fueled regional instability, empowered terrorist networks, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear capabilities that endanger international security. Its continued survival perpetuates these risks. Its removal would fundamentally alter the strategic landscape of the Middle East.

The Iranian people are doing the hard part themselves. What they need now is clarity from the international community—especially from the United States—about where it stands.

I urge you to:
* Take clear public action to isolate and weaken those responsible for directing violence against Iranian civilians

* Support decisive efforts to break the regime’s information blackout and restore open internet access

* Prepare the United States to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the Iranian people establish one


Moments like this are rare. Delayed or ambiguous responses prolong violence and embolden repression. Clear leadership can save lives and help close a chapter that has harmed both Iranians and global stability for decades.

Thank you for your attention and leadership at this critical time.

Sincerely,
