I'm writing as _____, Iranian-American, about the crisis in Iran.

What's happening: Nationwide uprising, millions in streets, regime killing civilians (12,000+ in 48 hours), total internet shutdown.

Why it matters: This regime has funded Hezbollah, pursued nukes, and destabilized the region for decades. Its collapse is America's biggest strategic opportunity in the Middle East since the Cold War.

What's needed: Communications tools, economic pressure, commitment to democratic transition.

The Iranian people are doing the hard work. They need minimal U.S. support to finish it and build a democratic ally of 90 million people.

Please champion this cause now.
