My name is _____. I'm writing as an Iranian-American about the crisis where millions fight for freedoms we cherish.

Since December, millions across hundreds of cities rose against 47 years of tyranny. The regime massacred 12,000+ in 48 hours, hunts wounded in hospitals, uses foreign mercenaries.

Complete digital blackout—1% connectivity. We cannot reach families.

U.S. ACTION NEEDED:
* Target IRGC to stop killing
* Block assets, oil smuggling
* Deploy Starlink
* Recognize democratic government

A free Iran: end of terrorism, 90M allies, regional peace through expanded Abraham Accords, economic powerhouse.

Every day of inaction means deaths.

Respectfully,
