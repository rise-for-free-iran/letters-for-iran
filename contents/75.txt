I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has entered a decisive phase in which hesitation carries real consequences.

What is unfolding is not political dissent in the usual sense. It is the collapse of a system that has exhausted its legitimacy and now depends almost entirely on force and isolation. Across Iran, millions are rejecting the Islamic Republic despite knowing the personal cost.

The state has answered with killings, mass arrests, and a sweeping shutdown of internet and communications to suppress coordination and conceal evidence. These measures reveal panic, not authority.

For decades, this regime has fueled terrorism, destabilized an entire region, threatened global energy routes, and driven nuclear escalation. Its endurance has repeatedly harmed U.S. interests. Its removal would mark a profound shift in Middle Eastern stability.

Clear U.S. leadership now can shorten the violence and influence what comes next. Silence and ambiguity will only increase the human cost.

Iran is changing regardless. How costly that change becomes will depend in part on U.S. clarity today.

Sincerely,
