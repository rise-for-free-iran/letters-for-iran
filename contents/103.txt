I am _____, writing as an Iranian in the United States because Iran’s uprising now intersects directly with U.S. strategic interests.

This is not a reform effort. Millions of Iranians are demanding the end of the Islamic Republic itself.

The regime has responded with killings, mass arrests, and an information blackout designed to hide repression.

For decades, this government has fueled terrorism, regional instability, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy security. Its collapse would remove a major source of instability.

U.S. leadership now—targeting those responsible for violence, breaking the blackout, and preparing to recognize a transitional authority—can shape what comes next.

Iran is nearing a decisive moment. Silence will not be neutral.

Sincerely,
