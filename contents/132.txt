I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a decisive crossroads.

Millions across Iran are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic. The regime has responded with violence and silence.

Killings, mass arrests, and a nationwide internet blackout now define the state’s response.

For decades, this regime has fueled terrorism, destabilized the region, and threatened U.S. interests through nuclear escalation and energy insecurity.

U.S. leadership now—breaking the information blackout and preparing for transition—can influence how this moment ends.

Delay benefits only those using violence.

Sincerely,
_____
