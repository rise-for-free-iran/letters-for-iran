I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has crossed into a moment where outcomes are being decided rapidly.

Millions across Iran are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic after decades of repression.

The regime’s response has been lethal force, mass arrests, and a deliberate internet blackout to conceal its actions.

This regime has long exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened energy security, and pursued nuclear escalation that harms U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. leadership now—publicly and strategically—can shorten the violence and influence a more stable transition.

Iran is approaching a historic break. U.S. clarity will matter.

Sincerely,
