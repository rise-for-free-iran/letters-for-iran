My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am writing to urge your immediate attention to the rapidly escalating situation in Iran.

Millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities are engaged in a nationwide uprising demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This is no longer a question of reform. It is an effort to dismantle a regime that has governed through violence and coercion for over four decades.

The regime has responded with extreme force—killing civilians, arresting thousands, and targeting wounded protesters. Simultaneously, it has imposed a near-total internet and communications blackout to conceal its actions.

This crisis directly implicates U.S. national security. The Islamic Republic has long been a primary source of regional instability, state-sponsored terrorism, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy routes. Its collapse would significantly reduce these risks and reshape the Middle East in favor of long-term stability.

I respectfully urge you to:

* Take public and concrete steps to weaken the regime’s repressive capacity and hold those directing violence accountable

* Support efforts to defeat the regime’s information blackout by enabling unrestricted internet access

* Prepare the United States to recognize a legitimate transitional government when the Iranian people establish one


The Iranian people are already risking everything. Timely U.S. leadership can accelerate a transition that serves both humanitarian imperatives and American strategic interests.

Please act now.

Sincerely,
