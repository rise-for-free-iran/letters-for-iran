I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian-American watching events in Iran with growing alarm.

Millions of people across hundreds of cities are risking everything to end decades of tyranny. The regime has responded with brutality and censorship.

Security forces are killing civilians while the government cuts off internet access to conceal the violence.

This is the same regime that has destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy supplies, and pursued nuclear escalation for decades.

U.S. action now—publicly, technologically, and diplomatically—can help limit the bloodshed and prepare for a post-regime future.

Neutrality in moments like this is not neutral at all.

Respectfully,
