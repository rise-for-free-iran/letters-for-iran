I am _____.

Iran's regime is dying. Millions are fighting for the same values America stands for. The regime has killed 12,000+ in 48 hours and cut all communications.

For American foreign policy, this is huge. The Islamic Republic has been the Middle East's primary destabilizer for 47 years. The Iranian people are removing it themselves.

They need: Starlink, sanctions on IRGC, asset freezes, recognition of transitional government.

America gains: major strategic victory, natural ally with massive resources, end of terrorism and nuclear threats.

Please introduce legislation and press the Administration.

This moment won't wait.
