My name is _____, an American-Iranian living in the US.
Iran is at a tipping point. The Islamic Republic is collapsing under the weight of a nationwide uprising. Millions are in the streets despite brutal repression.

The regime has killed over 12,000 in 48 hours and imposed total communications blackout. This is the death throes of a system that knows it's lost.

For U.S. interests, this is transformational. The regime has been our primary adversary for 47 years—funding terrorism, pursuing nukes, destabilizing allies. Its end removes all of that.

We need to support Starlink deployment, sanction regime leaders, and prepare to recognize a democratic Iran.

This moment won't come again. Please act.
