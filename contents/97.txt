I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran is experiencing a nationwide uprising with historic consequences.

Millions are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic despite lethal risk. This is not political unrest—it is a decisive break with the regime.

The government has answered with live fire, mass arrests, and a near-total internet blackout to hide its actions from the world.

For decades, this regime has been a central driver of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear risk, and threats to global energy security. Its collapse would remove a major threat to U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. positioning—publicly and strategically—can shorten the violence and influence the transition ahead.

Iran is approaching a critical threshold. U.S. clarity now will matter.

Sincerely,
