Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
