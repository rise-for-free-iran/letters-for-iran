I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a point where delay itself has consequences.

Across the country, millions of people are no longer demanding reforms. They are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright, even as the risks grow more severe by the day.

Violence, arrests, and an engineered information blackout now define the state’s response—measures that signal fear, not strength.

This regime’s survival has consistently undermined U.S. security interests and those of its allies across the region.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. leadership now will help determine whether that change is shorter and less violent, or prolonged and chaotic.

Sincerely,
_____
