I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has entered a decisive national confrontation.

Across the country, millions of people are demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This is not a reform movement; it is a wholesale rejection of the regime itself.

The government has responded with lethal force, mass arrests, and a near-total shutdown of internet and communications to hide the scale of repression.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy security, and pursued nuclear escalation—directly harming U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. action now—weakening those directing violence, breaking the information blackout, and preparing to recognize a transitional authority—can reduce bloodshed and shape what follows.

Iran is nearing a turning point. U.S. clarity matters.

Sincerely,
