I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because Iran’s crisis has entered a phase where clarity matters more than statements.

Millions are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright. This is not unrest but the collapse of legitimacy.

The state has answered with lethal violence and a communications blackout to hide its actions.

This regime has long undermined U.S. security through terrorism, regional instability, and nuclear risk.

Clear U.S. positioning—accountability for repression and readiness for transition—can shorten the crisis.

Iran is moving forward. Silence will shape the outcome.

Sincerely,
_____
