My name is _____. I am writing because events in Iran require urgent U.S. attention.

Millions of Iranians are openly confronting the Islamic Republic in a nationwide rejection of the regime. The government is killing civilians, arresting thousands, and has shut down communications to conceal evidence.

This matters to U.S. interests: For decades, this regime has fueled regional instability and threatened international security. Its collapse removes a major source of global risk.

I respectfully urge:
* Clear public action isolating those directing violence
* Support for breaking the information blackout
* Readiness to recognize a transitional government

Delayed responses prolong violence. Clear leadership saves lives.

Sincerely,
_____
