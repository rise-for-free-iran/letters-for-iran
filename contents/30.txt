I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran has reached a point where delay itself has consequences.

What began as resistance has become a nationwide break with a regime sustained only by force, censorship, and fear.

Authorities have answered with live fire, mass detentions, and a sweeping communications blackout designed to suppress coordination and erase evidence.

The Islamic Republic has long been a central driver of regional instability, proxy warfare, nuclear risk, and global energy insecurity.

Public clarity from the United States can change calculations inside Iran and help reduce bloodshed during an inevitable transition.

Sincerely,
_____
