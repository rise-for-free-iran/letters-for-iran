My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
