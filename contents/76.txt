My name is _____, and I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran is no longer approaching change—it is actively unraveling.

This is not a protest cycle or a reform effort. It is a nationwide rejection of a regime that governs through repression after losing the consent of its people. Millions across Iran are openly defying the Islamic Republic despite grave risks.

The response has been ruthless: lethal force against civilians, mass detentions, and a deliberate blackout of internet and communications to hide repression.

For more than forty years, this regime has been a driver of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear risk, and threats to global energy security. Its continued survival undermines U.S. interests. A transition away from it would fundamentally alter the strategic balance of the region.

What matters now is clarity. Clear signals from the United States can help reduce bloodshed and shape a more stable transition.

Iran is moving forward regardless. U.S. leadership will shape the outcome.

Sincerely,
