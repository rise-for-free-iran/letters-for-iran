My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

Authorities have opened fire on crowds and are committing mass arrests.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I urge you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
