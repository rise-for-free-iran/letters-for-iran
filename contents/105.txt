I am _____, an Iranian-American living in the United States, writing because Iran is facing one of the deadliest moments in its modern history.

Millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities are demanding an end to decades of theocratic rule. This is not symbolic protest—it is a nationwide struggle for democratic freedoms.

The regime has responded with mass killings, arrests, and the use of both domestic forces and foreign mercenaries against civilians. Reports describe wounded protesters executed in hospitals and victims buried in unmarked graves.

At the same time, the government has imposed an almost total digital blackout. Internet access has collapsed, cutting Iranians off from one another and from the world.

The United States has both moral standing and strategic interest in acting. Targeted pressure to weaken the regime’s capacity for violence, break the information blockade, and prepare for a legitimate transition can save lives.

A free Iran would be a force for stability, not chaos. Silence now has consequences.

Respectfully,
