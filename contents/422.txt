Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

The country is witnessing a nationwide uprising to end religious authoritarian rule.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Only global attention can help protect lives now.

Sincerely,
_____
