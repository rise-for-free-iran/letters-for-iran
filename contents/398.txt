My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
