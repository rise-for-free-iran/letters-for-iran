I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because Iran is witnessing one of the largest freedom movements of the modern era.

Across hundreds of cities, millions of people have risen against a regime that has ruled through repression for 47 years. The response has been mass killing, arrests, and systematic efforts to erase evidence.

Internet access has been reduced to near zero. Protesters are hunted in hospitals. Families are forced to search for loved ones in unmarked graves.

This regime has long been a source of terrorism, nuclear risk, and regional instability that threatens U.S. interests. Its removal would create an opportunity for lasting security and economic cooperation.

The United States can act now—by confronting the regime’s violence, breaking the communications blackout, and preparing to engage a democratic transition.

History will remember who spoke and who stayed silent.

Respectfully,
