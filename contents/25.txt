I am _____, an Iranian in the United States, writing because what happens in Iran now will echo far beyond its borders.

The scale and persistence of this movement make clear that the regime no longer governs by consent, but by coercion alone.

Violence, arrests, and an engineered information blackout now define the state’s response—measures that signal fear, not strength.

For decades, this regime has exported terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Public clarity from the United States can change calculations inside Iran and help reduce bloodshed during an inevitable transition.

Sincerely,
