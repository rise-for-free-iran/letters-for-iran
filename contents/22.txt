I am _____, an Iranian in the United States, writing because what happens in Iran now will echo far beyond its borders.

Across the country, millions of people are no longer demanding reforms. They are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright, even as the risks grow more severe by the day.

Violence, arrests, and an engineered information blackout now define the state’s response—measures that signal fear, not strength.

The Islamic Republic has long been a central driver of regional instability, proxy warfare, nuclear risk, and global energy insecurity.

Public clarity from the United States can change calculations inside Iran and help reduce bloodshed during an inevitable transition.

Sincerely,
_____
