I am _____, an Iranian-American, writing because events in Iran are accelerating faster than the world’s response.

The scale and persistence of this movement make clear that the regime no longer governs by consent, but by coercion alone.

The regime’s response has been lethal: shootings in the streets, mass arrests, targeted violence against the wounded, and a deliberate shutdown of internet and communications to hide its actions.

This regime’s survival has consistently undermined U.S. security interests and those of its allies across the region.

Ambiguity prolongs repression. Clear leadership can save lives and influence the course of what comes next.

Sincerely,
