Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian American pleading for your immediate attention to the crisis in Iran.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

The regime is blocking all digital channels to prevent information from getting out.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
