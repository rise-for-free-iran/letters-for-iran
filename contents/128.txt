I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American because events in Iran have reached a point where delay itself carries consequences.

This is not reform politics. Millions across Iran are rejecting the Islamic Republic outright, even as repression intensifies.

The state is responding with lethal force, mass arrests, and a deliberate nationwide internet blackout to suppress coordination and hide repression.

For the United States, this moment is strategic as well as moral. The Islamic Republic has long threatened U.S. interests through terrorism, regional conflict, energy insecurity, and nuclear escalation.

Clear U.S. positioning now—accountability, breaking the blackout, and readiness for a post-regime transition—can reduce violence.

Silence will be felt inside Iran.

Sincerely,
