I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian who believes this moment in Iran will define its future for generations.

Across the country, millions are no longer demanding change within the system. They are rejecting the Islamic Republic itself, even as repression intensifies.

The regime has responded with live fire, mass arrests, and a calculated shutdown of internet and communications to erase evidence and prevent coordination. These actions signal fear and loss of control.

This crisis is not isolated from U.S. interests. For decades, the Islamic Republic has exported instability, empowered terrorist networks, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear escalation. Its survival has carried a real cost for international security.

Clear U.S. positioning now can shorten the violence and influence a more stable outcome. Ambiguity will prolong repression and suffering.

Iran is changing. The question is how violent that change becomes.

Sincerely,
_____
