I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian concerned that Iran has reached a point of irreversible change.

This is not a protest movement seeking reform. It is the failure of a regime that has lost legitimacy and now relies on violence and isolation.

The government has answered with lethal force, mass arrests, and a deliberate shutdown of internet and communications to hide repression.

For more than forty years, this regime has been a driver of terrorism, regional instability, nuclear escalation, and threats to global energy security. Its survival has repeatedly harmed U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. leadership now can help reduce bloodshed and shape a more stable outcome.

Iran is changing regardless. The cost of that change is still being written.

Sincerely,
_____
