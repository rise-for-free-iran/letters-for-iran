My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

The country is witnessing a nationwide uprising to end religious authoritarian rule.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
