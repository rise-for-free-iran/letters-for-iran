My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

Iranians have been isolated through shutdowns of mobile and online networks.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
