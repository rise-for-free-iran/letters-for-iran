I'm writing as an Iranian-American about what's happening in Iran—and why it matters to you and your constituents.

Millions are fighting to end the Islamic Republic. The regime has responded by killing over 12,000 people in 48 hours and shutting down the internet entirely.

Here's the bottom line for American interests: This regime has been our biggest Middle East problem for half a century. The Iranian people are solving it for us. We just need to help them finish.

Support: Starlink deployment, IRGC sanctions, asset freezes, recognition of democratic transition.

Result: End of terrorism funding, nuclear threats, and regional chaos. Creation of America's strongest regional ally.

The window is now. History will remember your response.
