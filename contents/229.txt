Dear Senator,

My name is _____. As an Iranian in the U.S., I am asking for your support for the Iranian people.

Citizens from every region are united in calling for the collapse of the regime.

Security forces are killing peaceful protesters and dragging thousands into detention.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I respectfully ask you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
