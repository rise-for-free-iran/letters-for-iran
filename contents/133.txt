I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American because what happens in Iran now will echo far beyond its borders.

This is not reform or protest politics. Millions of Iranians are rejecting the Islamic Republic itself.

The government has responded with killings, arrests, and a nationwide blackout to suppress coordination and hide repression.

This regime’s survival has long harmed U.S. interests through terrorism, regional instability, and nuclear escalation.

Clear U.S. leadership now—accountability and readiness for transition—can shorten the violence and shape a more stable future.

Iran is approaching change regardless.

Sincerely,
