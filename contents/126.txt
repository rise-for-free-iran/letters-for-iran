I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian watching Iran cross into a decisive phase.

Across the country, millions are no longer asking for change within the system. They are demanding the end of the Islamic Republic itself.

The government’s response has been lethal force, mass arrests, and a deliberate communications blackout to conceal its actions. This is a strategy of survival through silence.

This regime has spent decades exporting terrorism, threatening global energy security, and destabilizing an entire region at direct cost to U.S. interests.

Public U.S. clarity now—challenging the blackout, signaling accountability, and preparing for a transition—can reduce bloodshed and influence what comes next.

Ambiguity will only extend repression.

Sincerely,
