My name is _____. I am an Iranian-American writing to you about a historic turning point in Iran.

Across Iran, millions are openly demanding the end of the Islamic Republic—not reform, but regime change. The government's response has been extreme: over 12,000 killed in 48 hours, mass arrests, and a nationwide internet blackout concealing these atrocities.

For 47 years, this regime has destabilized the Middle East through terrorism, nuclear threats, and proxy wars. Its collapse would fundamentally transform regional security and U.S. interests.

The Iranian people need targeted support:
* Break the information blackout with Starlink deployment
* Target IRGC leadership and freeze regime assets
* Commit to recognizing a democratic transitional government

Clear U.S. leadership now can shorten the violence and shape a stable outcome. Please act immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
