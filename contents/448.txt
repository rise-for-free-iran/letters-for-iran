My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, and I am urgently reaching out regarding the uprising in Iran.

In hundreds of cities, people are rising up to overthrow the clerical dictatorship.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

History is turning in Iran—please do not stay silent.

Sincerely,
_____
