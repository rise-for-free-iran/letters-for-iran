My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

Millions across Iran have taken to the streets demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.

The regime is using lethal force—shooting civilians and filling prisons.

There is no nationwide communication—no internet, no cellular connection.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Please act now—millions are risking their lives for freedom.

Sincerely,
_____
