I am _____, writing as an Iranian-American deeply alarmed by the speed and scale of violence in Iran.

Millions of civilians are confronting a regime that has lost legitimacy and now relies on mass murder and censorship to survive. Entire cities have been cut off from the world.

The government has imposed a near-total internet blackout while security forces carry out killings, arrests, and disappearances beyond public view.

This is the same regime that has spent decades exporting terror, threatening global energy markets, and advancing nuclear ambitions in defiance of international norms.

Clear U.S. action—public condemnation, efforts to restore internet access, and readiness to support a transitional government—can reduce bloodshed and shape a more stable future.

Inaction today will echo for years.

Respectfully,
