My name is _____. I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing about the rapidly escalating situation in Iran.

Across hundreds of cities, Iranians are engaged in a nationwide uprising to dismantle a regime that has governed through violence for over 40 years. Security forces are killing civilians and have imposed near-total internet blackout.

This implicates U.S. national security: The Islamic Republic is a primary source of terrorism, nuclear escalation, and threats to energy routes. Its collapse significantly reduces these risks.

I urge concrete steps to:
* Weaken the regime's repressive capacity
* Enable unrestricted internet access
* Recognize a legitimate transitional government

Timely leadership serves humanitarian and strategic interests.

Please act now.
