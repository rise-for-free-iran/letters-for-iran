Dear Senator,

My name is _____. I am an Iranian residing in America, and I am calling for your urgent involvement.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

Government forces have slaughtered protesters and terrorized communities.

The government cut off internet and phone service to hide its violence.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I strongly request that you:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Stand with democracy while this moment still matters.

Sincerely,
_____
