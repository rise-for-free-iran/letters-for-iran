I am an Iranian living in the United States, writing because events in Iran have reached a decisive point, and how the United States responds now will shape both the outcome and what follows.

Across Iran, millions of people are openly rejecting the Islamic Republic itself. This is not a protest cycle or a reform movement—it is a nationwide break with a regime sustained only through violence.

The government is responding by killing civilians, arresting thousands, and imposing a nationwide internet and communications blackout to hide its actions and suppress coordination. This blackout is deliberate and strategic, not incidental.

For the United States, this is more than a humanitarian crisis. The Islamic Republic has long been a central source of regional instability, terrorism, threats to global energy routes, and nuclear escalation. Its collapse would remove one of the most persistent drivers of insecurity in the Middle East.

What happens next will depend in part on international clarity. Public signals that those directing repression will face consequences, that information blackouts will be challenged, and that a post-regime transition will be taken seriously can shorten the violence and save lives. Silence and ambiguity will do the opposite.

Iran is moving toward transition whether the world prepares for it or not. U.S. leadership now can help shape that transition toward stability rather than prolonged bloodshed.

Sincerely,
