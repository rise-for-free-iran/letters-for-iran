My name is _____. I write as an Iranian American who cannot stay silent during this historic moment.

People of all backgrounds have mobilized to demand democratic change.

The dictatorship is responding with murder, suppression, and intimidation.

A complete digital blackout has been imposed to silence the rebellion.

This is a nationwide uprising for freedom, dignity, and human rights.

I implore you to:
• Publicly support Iranians demanding the end of the Islamic Republic.
• Condemn the killings, detentions, and state violence.
• Back international accountability for regime officials.
• Support technology efforts that break the blackout.

Time is critical—Iranians need your voice immediately.

Sincerely,
_____
