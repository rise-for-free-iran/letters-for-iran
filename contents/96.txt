I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian alarmed by the speed of events unfolding in Iran.

Millions of Iranians across hundreds of cities are demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This is a nationwide rejection, not a call for reform.

The regime’s response has been killings, mass detentions, and a deliberate communications blackout designed to conceal repression.

This same regime has spent decades fueling terrorism, destabilizing the region, threatening global energy routes, and advancing nuclear ambitions at the expense of U.S. security.

Public U.S. leadership now—targeting those responsible for violence, restoring access to information, and preparing for a post-regime transition—can save lives and shape a more stable outcome.

Iran is changing rapidly. Hesitation carries a cost.

Sincerely,
