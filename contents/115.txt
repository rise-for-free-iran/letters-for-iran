I am _____, an Iranian living in the United States, writing because the situation in Iran has reached a point where outside clarity can still save lives.

Across hundreds of cities and towns, millions of Iranians are demanding the end of the Islamic Republic. This is not a call for reform but a nationwide rejection of the regime itself, sustained despite extreme violence.

The government has responded by killing unarmed civilians, arresting thousands, targeting the wounded, and imposing a near-total internet blackout to hide the scale of repression.

For more than forty years, this regime has fueled terrorism, destabilized the Middle East, threatened global energy routes, and pursued nuclear ambitions—at repeated cost to U.S. interests.

Clear U.S. leadership now—publicly confronting those directing violence, breaking the information blackout, and preparing to recognize a legitimate transitional government—can shorten the violence and shape a more stable transition.

Iran is moving toward change regardless. U.S. clarity now will influence the human cost.

Sincerely,
