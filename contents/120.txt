I am _____, writing from the United States as an Iranian alarmed by the speed of events unfolding in Iran.

Millions of citizens across hundreds of cities are demanding an end to the Islamic Republic. This movement continues despite extreme violence.

The government has answered with mass killings, arrests, attacks on wounded protesters, and a near-total internet blackout to conceal repression.

This regime has long threatened U.S. interests through terrorism, regional instability, nuclear risk, and global energy insecurity.

Public U.S. action now—targeting those directing violence, breaking the information blackout, and preparing to recognize a legitimate transitional authority—can save lives.

Ambiguity will prolong bloodshed.

Sincerely,
