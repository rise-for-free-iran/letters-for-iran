I'm _____, Iranian-American, writing urgently about Iran.

The regime is collapsing. Millions demand its end. Response: 12,000+ dead in 48 hours, total internet blackout, foreign mercenaries in the streets.

Why you should care: This regime has funded terrorism, pursued nukes, and destabilized everything for 47 years. The Iranian people are ending it. We can help them finish quickly and transition to democracy, or watch prolonged chaos.

Actions needed: Starlink, IRGC sanctions, transitional government recognition.

The payoff: America's strongest regional ally with vast resources and 90 million educated people who already love America.

Simple choice. Please make it.
